- Additional info:
I collect and catalog technology research- OSINT like. For an example of my main interest, see: https://github.com/EI2030/Low-power-E-Paper-OS/blob/master/Hyperlinks%20and%20Scratchpad.md It is very mumbo jumbo, like a telephone directory, or Katmamari Damacy: https://youtu.be/JHsFcSNFUMc?t=50 Depending on how disorganized it appears to you, It's may or may not be more efficient using this method to collect and untangle later. My memory is like a snowball effect, it remembers a bit of everything it comes across and I infer new perspectives rarely do I entirely replace or forget old ideas with newer technologies, thus my minds' repositor is a prime candidate for a new open source platform. I do not know what technologies will be useful, but the concepts themselves can be mixed and matched like pieces of a puzzle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel
