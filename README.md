- Additional info:
I collect and catalog information- OSINT like Katmamari Damacy: https://youtu.be/JHsFcSNFUMc?t=50 It's more efficient to collect and untangle later. My memory is like a snowball effect, it remembers a bit of everything it comes across and I infer new perspectives rarely do I entirely replace or forget old ideas with newer technologies, thus my minds' repositor is a prime candidate for a new open source platform. I do not know what technologies will be useful, but the concepts themselves can be mixed and matched like pieces of a puzzle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel
